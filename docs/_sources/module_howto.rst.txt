How to make a module
********************

The VT Server functionality can be extended by creating new modules. This section
gives some pointers on how to do just that.

The basic principle is pretty straightforward. If we were writing a module called
"toto", we would have to define a function with the following signature:

.. code-block::

    def process_toto(in_filename, parameters, out_filename):
        ...
        return out_filename

in_filename
    The path to the input filename. It is either an original file,
    or an intermediary file passed on by the previous module in a stack of modules.

parameters
    The module's parameters definition. This is what a user pass to
    the module in a query.

out_filename
    Provided by the :mod:`vt_server_brain`. The module is responsible
    for writing the file down once the processing is finished. And needs to return the filename.

You need to save this module in a python file called :file:`vt_server_module_toto.py` if you
want the module to be automatically discovered by VTServer.

Types of modules
================

By default, modules are considered being of type `'modifier'`. However, modules can also be
of type `'generator'`. The only difference between the two is that the `modifier` modules
generate job-files that list the `in_filename` as source file, while `generator` modules have to
declare which files they are using (if any). That means that the `process_XXX` function needs to return
both `out_filename` and a list of source files.

Creating an interface
=====================

The first step should be to write some code to parse the module's parameters. When called by the brain,
the module function receives three arguments: the `in_filename`, the set of `parameters`, and the `out_filename`.

The `in_filename` is either referring to the `file` argument of the query (if this is a multi-file query,
each file of the array is passed in turn), or if the module is further in the processing stack,
it receives the output filename of the previous module in the stack. Note that when you run the VTServer
locally, you can use relative filepaths because you will know where the VTServer is running from. However, if
you run it through a web interface, i.e. through the AJAX/PHP client, the file roots will be automatically
rebased to the audio folder.

The `parameters` are only the parameters of the module itself, as a :obj:`dict`. This is what you need to define.
You are also responsible for testing the validity of the query. If some parameters are missing or inadequate, you
need to raise a :py:exc:`ValueError` exception who's description starts with module name between brackets:

.. code-block::

    raise ValueError("[world] Error while parsing argument %s (%s): %s" % (k, m[k], args))

There is no general strategy in deciding how to parametrise your module. However, it is useful to keep in
mind that the module parameters will likely be generated by some Javascript on a website. As a result, you should
only rely on types that can be translated into JSON. That means you cannot easily pass functions or binary data, unless
you use strings and a parser for the former, and if you encode the latter in something like base64. Also keep in mind
that the queries are sent over the internet, so they have to remain relatively light. That is, as much as possible
you should try to parametrise your module in a way that does not always require large queries to be sent.

For instance, in the :mod:`vt_server_module_gibberish` module, we made it possible to pass a list of files used
to produce the gibberrish as argument, but we also provided facilities to use wildcard shell patterns or regular
expressions to specify the file list from a given folder, thus reducing the need for sending queries containing
lists of potentially hundreds or thousands of filenames.

Keep in mind that the query results are cached: if the same query is sent again, it will not even be sent to
your function, but will be picked-up by the :mod:`vt_server_brain` before that. If your processing
contains random elements that need to be regenerated everytime, you should add a random seed as
parameter in your queries, and make sure to set the `cache` directive to a short enough value.

Cache management
================

When writing a module, you don't need to worry too much about caching results of queries,
but there's a few things you need to keep in mind to avoid unexpected results.
Cache is managed by the :mod:`vt_server_brain`. In other words, the job of the module
process function is just to read the input file, apply the modifications you need
to apply to the sound based on the parameters, and then save the result in **out_filename**.

The function also returns **out_filename**. However, if you need to generate any
intermediary files you will need handle caching of these files yourself. To that purpose,
you need to create a job-file for every file that you generate and that is meant
to remain on the server for some time. Use the :func:`vt_server_common_tools.job_file` function, in the
:py:mod:`vt_server_common_tools` module, for that purpose.

An example of this can be found in the `world` module where the result of the analysis
phase is saved in a file so that only synthesis needs to be done for new voice parameters.
We need to create a job file so that the cache clean-up routines can handle
these files properly.

Sound files are read, and written, with :mod:`soundfile`.

Naming convention
=================

The process function and you module file must follow a specific naming convention
to be automatically discovered by the server once placed in the server directory.

The module must be named `vt_server_module_`\ *name*\ `.py` and the process function to be called must be named
`process_`\ *name*.

For example, if your module is called "toto", the module file will be called
`vt_server_module_toto.py` and the process function will be called `process_toto`.

With this convention, the module can be called in a query with the name "toto":

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "action": "process",
        "file": "/home/toto/audio/Beer.wav",
        "stack": [
            {
                "module": "toto",
                "param1": "blahdiblah"
            }
        ]
    }
